Among these, dynamic scheduling techniques handle scheduling problems where the scheduler does not possess detailed information about the jobs, which may arrive at the shop at any time. In this paper, an intelligent agent based dynamic scheduling system is proposed. It consists of two independent components: the agent and the simulated environment. The agent selects the most appropriate priority rule according to the shop conditions in real time, while simulated environment performs scheduling activities using the rule selected by the agent. The agent is trained by an improved reinforcement learning algorithm through the learning stage and then it successively makes decisions to schedule the operations.},

Increase flexibility is needed to remain competitive and respond to rapidly changing markets. In this context, supplier selection represents one of the most important function to be performed by the purchasin- g department. The supplier selection is a multi-criterion problem which includes both qualitative and quantitative factors (criteria). In order to select the best suppliers it is necessary to make a trade off between these tangible and intangible factors some of which may conflict. This report deals with the 'supplier selection problem', where a state of the art is presented. We summarize the different selection criteria, the various problems of suppliers selection and the existing methods to solve the problem. A numerical example is presented to 1- illustrate the different selection criteria and methods and 2- to compare the advantages and the disadvantage of the selection methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-tenancy is a relatively new software architecture principle in the realm of the Software as a Service (SaaS) business model. It allows to make full use of the economy of scale, as multiple customers - &#x201C;tenants&#x201D; - share the same application and database instance. All the while, the tenants enjoy a highly configurable application, making it appear that the application is deployed on a dedicated server. The major benefits of multi-tenancy are increased utilization of hardware resources and improved ease of maintenance, resulting in lower overall application costs, making the technology attractive for service providers targeting small and medium enterprises (SME). Therefore, migrating existing single-tenant to multi-tenant applications can be interesting for SaaS software companies. In this paper we report on our experiences with reengineering an existing industrial, single-tenant software system into a multi-tenant one using a lightweight reengineering approach.},

The objective function considered is minimisation of the makespan. The conventional SA search scheme is replaced by a new design that takes into account the specificity of the solution space of project scheduling problems. For RCPSP, the search was based on an alternated activity and time incrementing process, and all parameters were set after preliminary statistical experiments done on test instances. For MRCPSP, we introduced an original approach using two embedded search loops alternating activity and mode neighbourhood exploration. The performance evaluation done on the benchmark instances available in the literature proved the efficiency of both adaptations that are currently among the most competitive algorithms for these problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Project scheduling is concerned with single-item or small batch production where scarce resources have to be allocated to dependent activities over time. Applications can be found in diverse industries such as construction engineering, software development, etc. Also, project scheduling is increasingly important for make-to-order companies where the capacities have been cut down in order to meet lean management concepts. Likewise, project scheduling is very attractive for researchers, because the models in this area are rich and, hence, difficult to solve. For instance, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem contains the job shop scheduling problem as a special case. So far, no classification scheme exists which is compatible with what is commonly accepted in machine scheduling. Also, a variety of symbols are used by project scheduling researchers in order to denote one and the same subject. Hence, there is a gap between machine scheduling on the one hand and project scheduling on the other with respect to both, viz. a common notation and a classification scheme. As a matter of fact, in project scheduling, an ever growing number of papers is going to be published and it becomes more and more difficult for the scientific community to keep track of what is really new and relevant. One purpose of our paper is to close this gap. That is, we provide a classification scheme, i.e. a description of the resource environment, the activity characteristics, and the objective function, respectively, which is compatible with machine scheduling and which allows to classify the most important models dealt with so far. Also, we propose a unifying notation. The second purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent developments. More specifically, we review exact and heuristic algorithms for the single-mode and the multi-mode case, for the time-cost tradeoff problem, for problems with minimum and maximum time lags, for problems with other objectives than makespan minimization and, last but not least, for problems with stochastic activity durations.},

  Abstract                 = {Workflow management systems (WfMSs) have been used to support various types of business processes for more than a decade now. In workflows or Web processes for e-commerce and Web service applications, suppliers and customers define a binding agreement or contract between the two parties, specifying quality of service (QoS) items such as products or services to be delivered, deadlines, quality of products, and cost of services. The management of QoS metrics directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. Therefore, when services or products are created or managed using workflows or Web processes, the underlying workflow engine must accept the specifications and be able to estimate, monitor, and control the QoS rendered to customers. In this paper, we present a predictive QoS model that makes it possible to compute the quality of service for workflows automatically based on atomic task QoS attributes. We also present the implementation of our QoS model for the METEOR workflow system. We describe the components that have been changed or added, and discuss how they interact to enable the management of QoS.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a make-to-order production system, where limited production capacity and order delivery requirements necessitate selective acceptance of the orders. Since tardiness penalties cause loss of revenue, scheduling and order acceptance decisions must be taken jointly to maximize total revenue. We present a tabu search algorithm that solves the order acceptance and scheduling problem on a single machine with release dates and sequence dependent setup times. We analyze the performance of the tabu search algorithm on an extensive set of test instances with up to 100 orders and compare it with two heuristics from the literature. In the comparison, we report optimality gaps which are calculated with respect to bounds generated from a mixed integer programming formulation. The results show that the tabu search algorithm gives near optimal solutions that are significantly better compared to the solutions given by the two heuristics. Furthermore, the run time of the tabu search algorithm is very small, even for 100 orders. The success of the proposed heuristic largely depends on its capability to incorporate in its search acceptance and scheduling decisions simultaneously.},

In this paper, we first describe our workflow model using the workflow queuing network. Then, we propose a method to systematically determine the critical path under the workflow model, and give an overall example that shows how our method works. In addition, several experiments are made to evaluate the accuracy of the critical path found.},

The algorithmis based on the idea of using disjunctive arcs for resolving conflicts that are created whenever sets of activities have to be scheduled whose total resource requirements exceed the resource availabilities in some periods. Four lower bounds are examined. The first is a simple lower bound based on longest path computations. The second and third bounds are derived from a relaxed integer programming formulation of the problem. The second bound is based on the Linear Programming relaxation with the addition of cutting planes, and the third bound is based on a Lagrangean relaxation of the formulation. This last relaxation involves a problem which is a generalization of the longest path computation and for which an efficient, though not polynomial, algorithm is given. The fourth bound is based on the disjunctive arcs used to model the problem as a graph. We report computational results on the performance of each bound on randomly generated problems involving up to 25 activities and 3 resources.},

An illustrative example sketches the impact of information sharing on networked manufacturing using three different kinds of bidding protocol expressing how firms aggregate their information to conform to networking requirements. Finally, the results show that higher networking flexibility in terms of price-time alternatives can be achieved when firms favor tight partnership relations, offering consequently a better scheduling performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Schedulers confronted with significant processing time uncertainty often discover that a schedule which is optimal with respect to a deterministic or stochastic scheduling model yields quite poor performance when evaluated relative to the actual processing times. In these environments, the notion of schedule robustness, i.e., determining the schedule with the best worst-case performance compared to the corresponding optimal solution over all potential realizations of job processing times, is a more appropriate guide to schedule selection. In this paper, we formalize the robust scheduling concept for scheduling situations with uncertain or variable processing times. To illustrate the development of solution approaches for a robust scheduling problem, we consider a single-machine environment where the performance criterion of interest is the total flow time over all jobs. We define two measures of schedule robustness, formulate the robust scheduling problem, establish its complexity, describe properties of the optimal schedule, and present exact and heuristic solution procedures. Extensive computational results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an optimal solution procedure for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) with generalized precedence relations (RCPSP-GPR) with the objective of minimizing the project makespan. The RCPSPGPR extends the RCPSP to arbitrary minimal and maximal time lags between the starting and completion times of activities. The proposed procedure is suited for solving a general class of project scheduling problems and allows for arbitrary precedence constraints, activity ready times and deadlines, multiple renewable resource constraints with time-varying resource requirements and availabilities, several types of permissible and mandatory activity overlaps and multiple projects. It can be extended to other regular and non-regular measures of performance. Essentially, the procedure is a depth-first branch-and-bound algorithm in which the nodes in the search tree represent the original project network extended with extra precedence relations to resolve a number of resource conflicts. These conflicts are resolved using the concept of minimal delaying modes, which is an extension of the notion of minimal delaying alternatives for the RCPSP. Several bounds and dominance rules are used to fathom large portions of the search tree. Extensive computational experience is reported.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The most efficient approximate procedures so far for the flowshop scheduling problem with makespan objective - i.e. the NEH heuristic and the iterated greedy algorithm - are based on constructing a sequence by iteratively inserting, one by one, the non-scheduled jobs into all positions of an existing subsequence, and then, among the so obtained subsequences, selecting the one yielding the lowest (partial) makespan. This procedure usually causes a high number of ties (different subsequences with the same best partial makespan) that must be broken via a tie-breaking mechanism. The particular tie-breaking mechanism employed is known to have a great influence in the performance of the NEH, therefore different procedures have been proposed in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no tie-breaking mechanism has been proposed for the iterated greedy. In our paper, we present a new tie-breaking mechanism based on an estimation of the idle times of the different subsequences in order to pick the one with the lowest value of the estimation. The computational experiments carried out show that this mechanism outperforms the existing ones both for the NEH and the iterated greedy for different CPU times. Furthermore, embedding the proposed tie-breaking mechanism into the iterated greedy provides the most efficient heuristic for the problem so far.},

The heuristic exploits the idea of ‘optimising’ partial schedules, already present in the NEH-heuristic (Omega 11 (1983) 91) with respect to makespan minimisation. We compare the proposed heuristic against the ones by Rajendran and Ziegler (Eur. J. Oper. Res. 32 (1994) 2541), and Woo and Yim (Comput. Oper. Res. 25 (1998) 175), which are considered the best constructive heuristics for flowtime minimisation so far. The computational experiments carried out show that our proposal outperforms both heuristics with respect to the quality of the solutions. Moreover, our heuristic can be embedded in an improvement scheme to build a composite heuristic in the manner suggested by Allahverdi and Aldowaisan (Int. J. Prod. Econom. 77 (2002) 71) for the flowtime minimisation problem. The so-constructed composite heuristic also improves the best results obtained by the original composite heuristics by Allahverdi and Aldowaisan.},

In this note, we first establish that the problem is NP-hard. We then go on to provide two pseudo-polynomial time algorithms which also show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time if either the job processing times or the job weights for the lateness penalty are equal. We further provide a fully polynomial time approximation scheme which always generates a solution within a specified percentage of the optimal.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we introduce the knapsack problem for perishable inventories concerning the optimal dynamic allocation of a collection of products to a limited knapsack. The motivation for designing such a problem comes from retail revenue management, where different products often have an associated lifetime during which they can only be sold, and the managers can regularly select some products to be allocated to a limited promotion space that is expected to attract more customers than the standard shelves. Another motivation comes from scheduling of requests in modern multiserver data centers so that quality-of-service requirements given by completion deadlines are satisfied. Using the Lagrangian approach we derive an optimal index policy for the Whittle relaxation of the problem in which the knapsack capacity is used only on average. Assuming a certain structure of the optimal policy for the single-inventory control, we prove indexability and derive an efficient, linear-time algorithm for computing the index values. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to provide indexability analysis of a restless bandit with bi-dimensional state (lifetime and inventory level). We illustrate that these index values are numerically close to the true index values when such a structure is not present. We test two index-based heuristics for the original, nonrelaxed problem: (1) a conventional index rule, which prescribes to order the products according to their current index values and promotes as many products as fit in the knapsack, and (2) a recently proposed index-knapsack heuristic, which employs the index values as a proxy for the price of promotion and proposes to solve a deterministic knapsack problem to select the products. By a systematic computational study we show that the performance of both heuristics is nearly optimal, and that the index-knapsack heuristic outperforms the conventional index rule.

We propose a new genetic algorithm approach to solve this problem. Subsequently, we compare it to two genetic algorithm concepts from the literature. While our approach makes use of a permutation based genetic encoding that contains problem-specific knowledge, the other two procedures employ a priority value based and a priority rule based representation, respectively. Then we present the results of our thorough computational study for which standard sets of project instances have been used. The outcome reveals that our procedure is the most promising genetic algorithm to solve the RCPSP.

The study proposes a bi-level optimization formulation to model the split delivery \{VRP\} with multiple trips to determine the minimum-distance route. The first stage optimally plans the collection points that cover all residential blocks. The second stage applies a heuristics method to solve the minimum vehicles used and minimum distance traveled for collecting residential waste. This research contributes to model this period \{VRP\} and to introduce the heuristics method to solve the problem efficiently. The study is important in laying the groundwork for understanding the possibility of improving the service level of municipal solid waste collection.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Innovative approaches to the assessment and management of medical technologies use a combination of health technology assessment (HTA) and operations research methods, specifically multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The purpose of this article is to develop methodological support and provide a theoretical justification for decision support in the selection of medical devices under conditions of uncertainty, using MRI systems as an example. The goal of the method application has been formulated as follows: determine a ranked list of MRI systems for contributory health organisations administered by regional authorities (regional hospitals) in the Czech Republic. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Delphi method were used to identify experts’ preferences and for consensus building. The expert group was selected based on eight complex-valued criteria, and each expert was given a weighting factor. A set of 13 MRI systems and the 14 key default specifications that play the most important roles when hospitals select MRIs for purchase were defined. Strong conformity (W ≥ 0.6, p &lt; 0.05) within the experts' judgments was revealed. A prediction regarding alternatives, weights and changes in priority vectors over the following 8 years has been provided. The developed approach is useful in decision support when selecting medical devices under conditions of uncertainty by hospitals.},

As with most computer science problems, representation of the data is the key to efficient and effective solutions. One of the most commonly used representations is piecewise linear approximation. This representation has been used by various researchers to support clustering, classification, indexing and association rule mining of time-series data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation, with several algorithms having been independently rediscovered several times. In this paper, we undertake the first extensive review and empirical comparison of all proposed techniques. We show that all these algorithms have fatal flaws from a data-mining perspective. We introduce a novel algorithm that we empirically show to be superior to all others in the literature},

To preempt the penalty that will be levied once a compliance violation is discovered in an inspection, the firm dynamically decides whether it should disclose a random occurrence of noncompliance. Anticipating this, the regulator determines inspection frequency and penalty amounts to minimize environmental and social costs, performing either random inspections or periodic inspections. We study this problem by developing a novel analytical framework that combines features from reliability theory and law enforcement economics. We find that, contrary to common belief, surprising the firm with random inspections is not always preferred to inspecting the firm periodically according to a set schedule. We also find that the firm?s opportunistic disclosure timing behavior may lead to a partial disclosure equilibrium in which the substitutable relationship between inspection intensity and penalty is reversed; a threat of increased penalty is accompanied by more frequent inspections.

The decision whether to accept or to reject a customers request in a current period influences his repurchase behavior in later periods. The allocation process becomes complex, when demand exceeds capacity, because the isolated determination and optimization of a single customers lifetime value is no longer feasible. Using a Markov decision process formulation, we study how to trade off short-term attainable revenues and long-term customer relationships. Furthermore, we analyze when and how intertemporal customer behavior influences capacity allocation. Finally, we investigate the impact of limited capacity on the customer lifetime value by introducing an opportunity cost-based approach that understands customer profitability as a customers contribution to customer equity.},

This article surveys the area of interval scheduling and presents proofs of results that have been known within the community for some time. We first review the complexity and approximability of different variants of interval scheduling problems. Next, we motivate the relevance of interval scheduling problems by providing an overview of applications that have appeared in literature. Finally, we focus on algorithmic results for two important variants of interval scheduling problems. In one variant we deal with nonidentical machines: instead of each machine being continuously available, there is a given interval for each machine in which it is available. In another variant, the machines are continuously available but they are ordered, and each job has a given “maximal” machine on which it can be processed. We investigate the complexity of these problems and describe algorithms for their solution. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2007},

  Abstract                 = {In most commercial electronic contract management applications available today, different customized code base has to be developed, deployed and operated to support each tenant. Few advanced commercial electronic contract management applications use a single code base with configuration options to support multi-tenants. However, a separate instance of the code base still has to be deployed and operated for each tenant even in these applications. The business model of having to support a single application instance for each tenant makes an electronic contract management application and other critical business applications out of reach for most small and medium businesses (SMBs), in particular, the very small businesses (SVBs) because of its high development and maintenance cost. Recently, a new business model of a single application instance supporting multi-tenancy based on software as a service (SaaS) has emerged making expensive business applications more affordable for SMBs and SVBs for multi-tenancy [1]. In this paper, we present the first of a kind multi-tenancy SaaS electronic contract management application. We also describe several novel methods used in the metadata, security and shared services, as well as customization and tenant extensions modules to support multi-tenancy SaaS in this application. This multi-tenancy SaaS application has shown to benefit both the application service providers as well as their tenants. This new multi-tenancy SaaS model can reduce the application hosting cost and make the application more affordable to the tenants because of its capabilities in customization and scalability while continuing to support an increasing number of tenants. It furthers benefits tenants by saving their money and time with immediate access to the latest IT innovations and infrastructure improvements on a single application code base. Most end users of tenants have found their productivities increased, the contract transaction time accelerated, contra- - ctual errors reduced in using this multi-tenancy SaaS electronic contract management application as demonstrated in several ongoing IBM pilot programs serving more than ten tenants with over 3000 end users.},

The optimal allocation of computing resources (OACR) is a core part for implementing CMfg. High heterogeneity, high dynamism, and virtualization make the OACR problem more complex than the traditional scheduling problems in grid system or cloud computing system. In this paper, a new comprehensive model for OACR is proposed in the CMfg system. In this model, all main computation, communication, and reliability constraints in the special circumstances are considered. To solve the OACR problem, a new improved niche immune algorithm was presented. Associated with the niche strategy, new heuristics are designed flexibly based on the characteristics of the problem and pheromone is added for adaptive searching. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed heuristic information and show NIA’s high performances for addressing the OACR problem compared with other intelligent algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A robust schedule is defined as a schedule that is insensitive to unforeseen shop floor disturbances given an assumed control policy. In this paper, a definition of schedule robustness is developed which comprises two components: post-disturbance make-span and post-disturbance makespan variability. We have developed robustness measures and robust scheduling methods for the case where a "right-shift"�control policy is used. On occurrence of a disruption, the right-shift policy maintains the scheduling sequence while delaying the unfinished jobs as much as necessary to accommodate the disruption. An exact measure of schedule robustness is derived for the case in which only a single disruption occurs within the planning horizon. A surrogate measure is developed for the more complex case in which multiple disruptions may occur. This surrogate measure is then embedded in a genetic algorithm to generate robust schedules for job-shops. Experimental results show that robust schedules significantly outperform schedules based on makespan alone.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the profitability of job selection decisions over a number of periods when current orders exceed capacity with the objective of maximizing profit (per-job revenue net of processing costs, minus weighted lateness costs), and when rejecting a job will result in no future jobs from that customer. First we present an optimal dynamic programming algorithm, taking advantage of the structure of the problem to reduce the computational burden. Next we develop a number of myopic heuristics and run computational tests using the DP as benchmark for small problems and the best heuristic as benchmark for larger problems. We find one heuristic that produces near-optimal results for small problems, is tractable for larger problems, and requires the same information as the dynamic program (current and future orders), and another that produces good results using historical information. Our results have implications for when it is more or less worthwhile to expend resources to maintain past records and obtain future information about orders. Scope and purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate trade-offs between accepting or rejecting job orders, completing processing on time and guaranteeing timeliness with money-back guarantees, when job selection decisions will affect future orders. These issues are important to firms that must balance short- and long-term profitability and maintain their customer base in competitive markets. We present a multi-period model that can be solved optimally with a dynamic program, and develop several heuristics which we evaluate with computational studies. We find that our heuristics that use either historical information or future estimates of sales produce good results for relatively large problems without the computational limitation of the optimal procedure. Our studies provide insights into when it is worthwhile for a firm to keep (and process) historical sales information, and seek accurate estimates of future orders.},

  Abstract                 = {Make-to-order (MTO) operations have to effectively manage their capacity to make long-term sustainable profits. This objective can be met by selectively accepting available customer orders and simultaneously planning for capacity. We model a MTO operation of a job-shop with multiple resources having regular and non-regular capacity. The MTO firm has a set of customer orders at time zero with fixed due-dates. The process route, processing times, and sales price for each order are given. Since orders compete for limited resources, the firm can only accept some orders. In this paper a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) is proposed to aid an operational manager to decide which orders to accept and how to allocate resources such that the overall profit is maximized. A branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm is devised to solve the MILP effectively. The MILP is first decomposed into a master problem and several sub-problems using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. Each sub-problem is represented as a network flow problem and an exact procedure is proposed to solve the sub-problems efficiently. We also propose an approximate B&amp;P scheme, Lagrangian bounds, and approximations to fathom nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. Computational analysis shows that the proposed B&amp;P algorithm can solve large problem instances with relatively short time.},

We first introduce a network-oriented organizational strategy according to which a manufacturing business dynamically organizes its operations through the configuration and activation of a distributed network of interdependent responsible manufacturing centers. Then, we present a collaborative relationships strategy as a contractual approach to implement operational networks. Finally, we introduce an operational strategy, showing how this networked collaborative approach can be used to manage day-to-day activities and contingencies in a close-to-reality manner. The concepts underlying the strategic framework are illustrated using a simplified case inspired by our manufacturing partner, a world-class motorcoach manufacturer.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper addresses the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with flexible resource profiles (FRCPSP). Such a problem often arises in many real-world applications, in which the resource usage of an activity is not merely constant, but can be adjusted from period to period. The FRCPSP is, therefore, to simultaneously determine the start time, the resource profile, and the duration of each activity in order to minimize the makespan, subject to precedence relationships, limited availability of multiple resources, and restrictions on resource profiles. We propose four discrete-time model formulations and compare their model efficiency in terms of solution quality and computational times. Both preprocessing and priority-based heuristic methods are also applied to compute both upper and lower bounds of the makespan. Our comparative results show significant dominance of one of the models, the so-called “variable-intensity-based” model, in both solution quality and runtimes.},

  Abstract                 = {Simply looking for vendors offering the lowest prices is not “efficient sourcing” any more. Selection of suppliers is a multiple criteria decision. We propose a weighted linear program for the multi-criteria supplier selection problem. In addition to mathematical formulation, this paper studies a transformation technique which enables our proposed model to be solved without an optimizer. The model for multi-criteria supplier selection problem can be easily implemented with a spreadsheet package. The model can be widely applied to practical situations and does not require the user with any optimization background.},

The capacity available for processing the accepted orders is limited and each order is characterized by a known processing time, delivery date, revenue and a weight representing a penalty per unit-time delay beyond the delivery date. We prove that the existence of a constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem is unlikely. We propose two linear formulations that are solved using an IP solver and we devise two exact branch-and-bound procedures able to solve instances with up to 50 jobs within reasonable CPU times. We compare the efficiency and quality of the results obtained using the different solution approaches.},

On the other hand, each job may consist of many identical items. Splitting a job often results in improved customer service or in reduced throughput time. Thus, implicit in determining a schedule is a lot-sizing decision which specifies how a job is to be split. This paper proposes a general model which combines batching and lot-sizing decisions with scheduling. A review of research on this type of model is given. Some important open problems for which further research is required are also highlighted.},

The basic objective is to look for a production schedule that can optimally utilize the resources of both the in-house production and outsourcing so that the makespan is minimized. The logistics issue between the subcontractor and the in-house shop further complicates the problem. We present models for different situations of outsourcing. For each model, we develop optimization algorithms and conduct computational experiments to study the managerial insights for the models and the algorithms. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper uses a genetic algorithm to solve the order-acceptance problem with tardiness penalties. We compare the performance of a myopic heuristic and a genetic algorithm, both of which do job acceptance and sequencing, using an upper bound based on an assignment relaxation. We conduct a pilot study, in which we determine the best settings for diversity operators (clone removal, mutation, immigration, population size) in connection with different types of local search. Using a probabilistic local search provides results that are almost as good as exhaustive local search, with much shorter processing times. Our main computational study shows that the genetic algorithm always dominates the myopic heuristic in terms of objective function, at the cost of increased processing time. We expect that our results will provide insights for the future application of genetic algorithms to scheduling problems. Scope and purpose The importance of the order-acceptance decision has gained increasing attention over the past decade. This decision is complicated by the trade-off between the benefits of the revenue associated with an order, on one hand, and the costs of capacity, as well as potential tardiness penalties, on the other. In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to solve the problem of which orders to choose to maximize profit, when there is limited capacity and an order delivered after its due date incurs a tardiness penalty. The genetic algorithm improves upon the performance of previous methods for large problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper addresses a bicriteria no-wait flow-shop scheduling problem with multiple robots transferring jobs between pairs of consecutive machines. The robots share an identical track positioned alongside the machine transfer line. Each robot is assigned to a portion of the tract from which it performs job transfers between all reachable machines. We assume that job processing times are both machine and job independent, that jobs are not allowed to wait between two consecutive machines and that machine idle times are not allowed. We define a combined robot selection and scheduling problem ( RSSP ) for a set of Q non-identical robots characterized by different costs and job transfer and empty movement times. A solution to the RSSP problem is defined by (i) selecting a set of robots, (ii) assigning each robot to a portion of the track, and (iii) scheduling the robot moves. We define a robot schedule as feasible if all the jobs satisfy the no-wait condition and there are no machine idle times. The quality of the solutions are measured by two criteria (performance measures): makespan and robot selection cost. We study four different variations of the RSSP , one which is shown to be solvable in polynomial time while the other three turn out to be NP -hard. For the NP -hard, we show that a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and a fully polynomial approximation scheme exists, and derive three important special cases which are solvable in polynomial time. The RSSP has aspects of robot selection, machine-robot assignment and robot movement scheduling. We believe this is the first time that this type of problem has been treated in the literature, and addresses a very important problem in multiple robotic systems operation. Our contribution lies in the formulation, methodology, algorithms for solution and complexity results which jointly treats all aspects of the problem simultaneously without the need to defer to heuristic decomposition methods.},

In a firm that strives to align its functions so that profit is maximized, the coordination of capacity with demand may require that business sometimes be turned away. In particular, there is a trade-off between the revenue brought in by a particular order, and all of its associated costs of processing. The present study focuses on the body of research that approaches this trade-off by considering two decisions: which orders to accept for processing, and how to schedule them. This paper presents a taxonomy and a review of this literature, catalogs its contributions and suggests opportunities for future research in this area.},

This paper examines order acceptance decisions when capacity is limited, customers receive a discount for late delivery, but early delivery is neither penalized nor rewarded. We model a manufacturing facility that considers a pool of orders, and chooses for processing the subset that results in the highest profit. We present several solution methods, beginning with a straightforward application of an approach which separates sequencing and job acceptance. We then develop an optimal branch-and-bound procedure that uses a linear (integer) relaxation for bounding and performs the sequencing and job acceptance decisions jointly. We develop a variety of fast and high-quality heuristics based on this approach. For small problems, beam search runs almost 20 times faster than the benchmark, with a high degree of accuracy, and a branch-and-bound heuristic using Vogel's method for bounding is over 100 times faster with very high accuracy. For larger problems, a myopic heuristic based on the relaxation runs 2000 times faster than the beam-search benchmark, with comparable accuracy.},

This motivates us to formulate the objective function in terms of revenues minus costs, in order to reflect the trade-offs faced by the firm itself, which views costs mainly in the context of the reduction of its profits. We present a model that uses weighted lateness as a criterion for time-related penalties. Taking advantage of two special characteristics of the problem, we develop an optimal algorithm and two heuristic procedures. Computational results show that the myopic heuristic demonstrates near-optimal performance in a fraction of the processing time of the optimal benchmark.},

Three categories of constrained resources are considered in a general model: renewable (only total usage at every moment is constrained), non-renewable (only total consumption over the period of project duration is constrained) and doubly-constrained (both usage and consumption are constrained). For every feasible combination of resource amounts, the performing time of each activity is known. Time and cost criteria are considered for project performance evaluation. For solving these problems, two general approaches using linear programming in specific ways are described. These approaches are different in nature, the difference being reflected in the range of problems solved by them and in their computational properties. This is shown by an extensive comparison of both approaches. This comparison also characterizes the state-of-the-art across the problems and points out desirable directions for further research.},

In this paper, we first describe our workflow model with a set of workflow control constructs that provide sufficient power to express the models of most of today's business processes. Then, we propose a systematic method of identifying the critical path for a given workflow schema. Our proposed method is based on queuing theory because operational characteristics of the workflow schema can be modeled by a M/M/1 queuing network.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Since the appearance of cloud computing, computing capacity has been charged as a service through the network. The optimal scheduling of computing resources (OSCR) over the network is a core part for a cloud service center. With the coming of virtualization, the OSCR problem has become more complex than ever. Previous work, either on model building or scheduling algorithms, can no longer offer us a satisfactory resolution. In this paper, a more comprehensive and accurate model for OSCR is formulated. In this model, the cloud computing environment is considered to be highly heterogeneous with processors of uncertain loading information. Along with makespan, the energy consumption is considered as one of the optimization objectives from both economic and ecological perspectives. To provide more attentive services, the model seeks to find Pareto solutions for this bi-objective optimization problem. On the basis of classic multi-objective genetic algorithm, a case library and Pareto solution based hybrid Genetic Algorithm (CLPS-GA) is proposed to solve the model. The major components of CLPS-GA include a multi-parent crossover operator (MPCO), a two-stage algorithm structure, and a case library. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of CLPS-GA in terms of convergence, stability, and solution diversity.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of manufacturing grid (MGrid) is to utilize manufacturing resources distributed in heterogeneous systems and different places to collaboratively manufacture products the market requires. The solution is based on adopting grid technologies, information technologies, advanced manufacturing technologies, management technologies, etc., to realize the complete sharing of all kinds of geographically distributed and heterogeneous manufacturing resources in the form of virtual enterprises. After summarizing the grid technology and its applications, we propose the concept of MGrid. The application of grid technology in manufacturing and the related works about MGrid are investigated. The connotation of MGrid are put forward, including its basic features, the structure and main functions, the main research contents, the architecture, and key technologies. A resource service optimal-selection system of MGrid and its main functions are researched, including resource service description, resource service publication, resource service discovery, resource service quality of service (QoS) evaluation, and resource service optimal-selection evaluation. An application prototype, namely magnetic bearing resources sharing and service platform under manufacturing grid, is developed. It validates the resource service sharing and optimal-selection system in MGrid.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to realize the full-scale sharing, free circulation and transaction, and on-demand-use of manufacturing resource and capabilities in modern enterprise systems (ES), Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) as a new service-oriented manufacturing paradigm has been proposed recently. Compared with cloud computing, the services that are managed in CMfg include not only computational and software resource and capability service, but also various manufacturing resources and capability service. These various dynamic services make ES more powerful and to be a higher-level extension of traditional services. Thus, as a key issue for the implementation of CMfg-based ES, service composition optimal-selection (SCOS) is becoming very important. SCOS is a typical NP-hard problem with the characteristics of dynamic and uncertainty. Solving large scale SCOS problem with numerous constraints in CMfg by using the traditional methods might be inefficient. To overcome this shortcoming, the formulation of SCOS in CMfg with multiple objectives and constraints is investigated first, and then a novel parallel intelligent algorithm, namely full connection based parallel adaptive chaos optimization with reflex migration (FC-PACO-RM) is developed. In the algorithm, roulette wheel selection and adaptive chaos optimization are introduced for search purpose, while full-connection parallelization in island model and new reflex migration way are also developed for efficient decision. To validate the performance of FC-PACO-RM, comparisons with 3 serial algorithms and 7 typical parallel methods are conducted in three typical cases. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for addressing complex SCOS in CMfg.},

  Abstract                 = {In manufacturing grid (MGrid) system, according to functional requirements of a task, there exist a lot of resource services which have similar functional characteristics. Multiple resource services with similar functional characteristics raise the concern over resource service optimal-selection (RSOS). It is important to select the optimal resource service according to their non-functionality characteristics or quality of service (QoS). However, QoS attributes are not easy to measure due to their complexity and involvement of ill-structured information. In this study, user's feeling is taken into account in RSOS in an MGrid system. The non-functionality QoS evaluation of resource services is based on users' feeling and transaction experiences using intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS). Furthermore, the dynamics of non-functionality QoS is considered, and a time-decay function is introduced into non-functionality QoS evaluation. A new method is proposed for RSOS based on IFS and non-functionality QoS, and the procedures are presented in detail. A practice case study is used to illustrate the proposed method and procedure. The performance and advantage of the proposed method are discussed.},

We then apply approximate linear programming (ALP) to overcome the DP's curse of dimensionality, obtain a semi-infinite linear programming lower bound, and discuss its tractability.

This model creates a brand new opportunity for enterprises. In this paper, some of the essential features of cloud computing are briefly discussed with regard to the end-users, enterprises that use the cloud as a platform, and cloud providers themselves. Cloud computing is emerging as one of the major enablers for the manufacturing industry; it can transform the traditional manufacturing business model, help it to align product innovation with business strategy, and create intelligent factory networks that encourage effective collaboration. Two types of cloud computing adoptions in the manufacturing sector have been suggested, manufacturing with direct adoption of cloud computing technologies and cloud manufacturing--the manufacturing version of cloud computing. Cloud computing has been in some of key areas of manufacturing such as IT, pay-as-you-go business models, production scaling up and down per demand, and flexibility in deploying and customizing solutions. In cloud manufacturing, distributed resources are encapsulated into cloud services and managed in a centralized way. Clients can use cloud services according to their requirements. Cloud users can request services ranging from product design, manufacturing, testing, management, and all other stages of a product life cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Combining with the emerged technologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of things, service-oriented technologies and high performance computing, a new manufacturing paradigm ? cloud manufacturing (CMfg) ? for solving the bottlenecks in the informatisation development and manufacturing applications is introduced. The concept of CMfg, including its architecture, typical characteristics and the key technologies for implementing a CMfg service platform, is discussed. Three core components for constructing a CMfg system, i.e. CMfg resources, manufacturing cloud service and manufacturing cloud are studied, and the constructing method for manufacturing cloud is investigated. Finally, a prototype of CMfg and the existing related works conducted by the authors' group on CMfg are briefly presented.
